The implementation is solid and includes good test coverage for the new logic. My review focuses on a few key areas for improvement: enhancing security by removing default credentials, improving maintainability by fetching dynamic data instead of hardcoding it, fixing a broken test case, and improving frontend performance with debouncing.","submittedAt":"2025-12-21T06:38:46Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED","commit":{"oid":"d220481fc1670a998134a6aa1ef377960dc7dff5"}},{"id":"PRR_kwDOPIYOOs7Wq1R4","author":{"login":"gemini-code-assist"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"## Code Review\n\nThis pull request introduces an advanced year filtering feature for the rankings page, including backend logic for parsing year ranges and a new frontend input component. The backend implementation, including the sanitization utility and its tests, is well-done. However, there are several critical issues. The new `YearRangeInput` React component contains multiple hook rule violations and syntax errors that will cause it to fail. Additionally, a unit test for the `Rankings` page has not been updated to reflect the new input component, leaving the new functionality untested. There is also a critical security vulnerability in `docker-compose.yml` due to weak default credentials. Finally, a medium-severity issue is the hardcoded year range on the frontend, which should be made dynamic.","submittedAt":"2025-12-21T06:47:33Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED","commit":{"oid":"eb4e6f3f2096ca15d393aefd157d26cdcdff8535"}}]}
