## Code Review

This pull request introduces an advanced year filtering feature for the rankings page, with changes across the backend and frontend. The backend now includes a utility for parsing year strings, updated controller logic for flexible MongoDB queries, and a new endpoint to fetch available years. The frontend adds a new `YearRangeInput` component. While the feature is well-conceived and includes new tests, there are several critical issues. The new React component `YearRangeInput.tsx` contains severe anti-patterns and syntax errors that will prevent it from working. There's also a bug in how the frontend consumes the new API endpoint. Additionally, some tests are outdated or could be more thorough, and there are maintainability and security issues like hardcoded credentials and magic numbers that should be addressed.
